# Super-Firmware_Cache
Custom FC Cache for Super-Patcher
*******************************************************************************************************************************************

This repo is under construction. This will eventually be a place for in depth information regarding the flight controllers that are supplied by Super-Patcher. This will include the flyc_param_infos file for each flight controller which is a list of all parameters including hard-coded parameters, a readme file which gives a brief synopsis of features of the flight controller, the flight controller version# which is used to verify installation with Super-Patcher, and the 306.unsig which is the original stock flight controller with the first layer of encryption removed (this aids advanced users who wish to build their own custom flight controller.) These files are helpful for those who require in depth information regarding the Super-Patcher flight controllers. 

Warning: These are Experimental Flight controllers and only I know what they do and how to install them. I need this as a public repo so I can download them remotely but DO NOT USE THEM unless I specifically tell you to with instructions on how to install them
