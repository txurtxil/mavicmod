# Mavic Pro Super-Patcher + battery mod Flight Controller Variant 

***This mod is for advanced pilots ONLY!!! Please read discription and fully understand the ramifications before using. Pilot is solely resposible for monitoring battery level.***

# DO NOT USE IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND!!

This is a variant of the original Super Patcher Flight controller that has all original Super Patcher mods but the battery parameters have already been set for optimal use for advanced users. 

New flight controller # is 03.02.44.11

The forced landing has been totally disabled but you retain the low battery warning at 20% remaining batter and critical battery level is now at 5% indicating that you should land immediatly however it will not do this automatically. Remaining flight time indicator is active and will show you when the aircraft thinks you should rth. This can be further customized in Assistant 2 1.1.2 in debug mode. If Smart RTH is active the aircraft will rth and land with 5% battery remaining though this can be declined in flight and this level can be further customized in Assistant 2 1.1.2 by the user. 

***WARNING if battery level is not monitored by the pilot the aircraft can potentially fall from the sky if it runs out of battery. If this makes you uncomfortable, use your mouse and click the little x in the upper right corner of your browser now and step away from the computer!!***
